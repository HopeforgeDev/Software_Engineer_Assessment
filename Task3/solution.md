### **Systematic Debugging Approach for Online Bookstore Discount Issue**

#### **1. Replicate the Issue Consistently**  
- **Test Cases**:  
  - Apply `SAVE20` as both a **member** and **non-member** with varying order totals (e.g., $50, $100, $200).  
  - Check if the discount fluctuates based on time, user location, or browser.  
- **Goal**: Confirm the conditions under which the bug occurs (e.g., only for members, specific order ranges).  

---

#### **2. Review Recent Code Changes**  
- **Focus**: Examine the updated discount logic in the latest release.  
  - Check for hardcoded values (e.g., `0.1` instead of `0.2`).  
  - Look for conditional statements tied to membership status or order total.  
  - Example:  
    ```python
    # Suspect code snippet
    if user.is_member and order_total > 100:
        discount = 0.4  # Bug: Should be 0.2?
    ```  
- **Key Question**: Does the new logic accidentally override the promo code’s 20% rule?  

---

#### **3. Validate Promo Code Configuration**  
- **Database Check**: Ensure `SAVE20` is configured correctly in the promo codes table.  
  - Verify `discount_percent = 20%`, with no conflicting start/end dates.  
  - Check for overlapping rules (e.g., "member-exclusive discounts" overriding `SAVE20`).  

---

#### **4. Analyze Logs & Debug Data**  
- **Logs to Inspect**:  
  - Discount calculation steps (e.g., `Applied SAVE20: 20% → overridden by membership tier`).  
  - User session data (e.g., `membership_status`, `order_total`).  
- **Example Log Entry**:  
  ```
  [ERROR] DiscountService: Member discount (40%) applied instead of SAVE20 (20%).
  ```  

---

#### **5. Test Edge Cases & Dependencies**  
- **Scenarios**:  
  - Order total = $0 (should reject promo).  
  - Order total = $10,000 (verify no caps on discount amounts).  
  - Apply `SAVE20` with other promo codes (e.g., `FREESHIPPING`).  
- **Goal**: Identify hidden dependencies (e.g., tiered pricing, stacking rules).  

---

#### **6. Check Caching & Session Data**  
- **Potential Issue**: Cached discount rates from prior sessions.  
  - Clear server-side and client-side caches.  
  - Test in incognito mode to rule out browser cache interference.  

---

#### **7. Unit/Integration Testing**  
- **Test Suite**:  
  ```python
  def test_SAVE20_non_member():
      assert apply_discount(100, "SAVE20", is_member=False) == 80  # Expect $80 after 20% off
  
  def test_SAVE20_member():
      assert apply_discount(100, "SAVE20", is_member=True) == 80  # Should NOT apply extra member discounts
  ```  
- **Outcome**: Failures here pinpoint calculation errors.  

---

#### **8. Isolate the Root Cause**  
- **Likely Causes**:  
  1. **Membership Override**: Member-specific discounts overriding `SAVE20`.  
  2. **Order Total Thresholds**: Incorrect conditional checks (e.g., `if order_total > 50: apply 10%`).  
  3. **Code Typo**: `discount = 0.1` instead of `0.2`.  

---

#### **9. Fix & Regression Testing**  
- **Patch Example**:  
  ```python
  # Before (buggy)
  def apply_discount(order_total, promo_code, is_member):
      if is_member:
          return order_total * 0.4  # Incorrect override
      # ... promo logic ...
  
  # After (fixed)
  def apply_discount(order_total, promo_code, is_member):
      if promo_code == "SAVE20":
          return order_total * 0.8  # Enforce 20% discount
  ```  
- **Post-Fix Checks**:  
  - Re-run all test cases (TC1–TC6).  
  - Monitor production logs for 24 hours.  

---

### **Summary of Findings**  
- **Most Likely Culprit**: Membership status overriding `SAVE20` due to flawed conditional logic.  
- **Uncovered Functionality**: The bug likely stems from **F1 (discount logic)** and **F5 (user status checks)**.  
- **Prevention**: Add unit tests for promo codes and membership interactions.
